**Introduction:**
This is an SQL Analysis for a Supermart Store, showing the Names,Departments,Salaries,State of each workers in the Store.
Areas covered in the analysis includes DDL,DML,TCL,TQL(of course because i did a lot of **SELECTING**:see_no_evil:) You will definitely find more query languages along the line in this project:yum:


_Disclaimer_ This project is done to improve my skills and to show that to a fault,i can use all these query languages appropraitely.The names,values are imaginary.Lets jump right in :boom:

Lets create the **Database** that will house our queries
